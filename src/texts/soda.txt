:cup_with_straw: You drink {1-4:sodas_daily} Diet Cokes per day, at a cost of ${0.00-3.50:soda_cost} per Diet Coke. If you'd put that into a fund with a {8.00:return}% annual rate of return, you'd have ${=((((sodas_daily * 365) * soda_cost) / 12) * (((1 + ((return/100)/12)) ^ 120) - 1) / ((return/100)/12)):total} within a decade. :+1:
