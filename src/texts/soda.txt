:cup_with_straw: You drink {1-4:sodas_daily} Diet Cokes per day, at a cost of ${0.00-3.50:soda_cost} per Diet Coke. (${=sodas_daily * soda_cost * 365.25/12:monthly} a month). If you'd put that into a fund with a {6.00:rate}% annual rate, you'd have ${=(monthly * (1 + rate/100/12)^120) + (monthly * (((1 + rate/100/12)^120) - 1)):total} in a decade.
