    <p>Hello it's me your pal Paul Ford. I live in America.</p>

    <p>I was born in {{born=range:[1950,2000]}}.</p>

    <p>I plan to work until I'm {{retireage=range:[60,80]}} and live until I'm {{maxage=range:[40,100]}} years of age. That means I have {{workyears=math:(retireage - (2021 - born))}} years of work left and {{years=math:(maxage - (2021 - born))}} years of life left, and {{weeks=math:(years * 52)}} weeks.</p>

    <p>This means I can eat {{meals=math:(weeks * 7 * 3)}} meals. I'll spend {{commute=math:(years * 200 * 2)}} hours commuting, which means I can listen to {{podcasts=math:(commute*2)}} podcasts, as long as they're normal length, not just people talking for hours.</p>

    <p>Or I could just spend {{twitter=math:(years * 365 * 6)}} hours on Twitter.</p>
